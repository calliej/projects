I kept receiving a 401 error, so the price never updated correctly. 

I used the client id and client secret value from my credentials .txt file as the example indicated, and I used the product id/sku I set up in the product settings (100) and the product id the ngrok window showed (112). None of these combinations seemed to work for me. 

I thought about changing the body of the put request to change something other than the price, but then I figured it would return the same 401 error about credentials.
